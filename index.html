            Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid
            development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced
            developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development,
            so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the
            wheel. It’s free and open source. Ridiculously fast. Django was
            designed to help developers take applications from concept to
            completion as quickly as possible. Reassuringly secure. Django takes
            security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security
            mistakes. Exceedingly scalable. Some of the busiest sites on the Web
            leverage Django’s ability to quickly and flexibly scale.

            Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms
            including Usenet, commercial online services such as GEnie, Byte
            Information Exchange (BIX) and the early CompuServe, e-mail
            lists,[14] and Bulletin Board Systems (BBS). In the 1990s, Internet
            forum software created running conversations with "threads". Threads
            are topical connections between messages on a virtual "corkboard".
            From June 14, 1993, Mosaic Communications Corporation maintained
            their "What's New"[15] list of new websites, updated daily and
            archived monthly. The page was accessible by a special "What's New"
            button in the Mosaic web browser.

            The modern blog evolved from the online diary where people would
            keep a running account of the events in their personal lives. Most
            such writers called themselves diarists, journalists, or journalers.
            Justin Hall, who began personal blogging in 1994 while a student at
            Swarthmore College, is generally recognized as one of the earlier
            bloggers,[17] as is Jerry Pournelle.
